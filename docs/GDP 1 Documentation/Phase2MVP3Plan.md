# GDP-2 (next semester)

## All user stories for GDP-2

### MVP Phase 1 :
 1. As a user, I want to see a public page with contact information for the company and link to their Facebook page and/or website.[Santosh,Yashwanth]		
2.	As an administrator, I want to log in (so only authorized users can create estimates).[Santosh]

### MVP Phase 2 :
1.	As an administrator, when creating a new estimate, I want to enter:
•	unique job name string
•	location string
•	int number of square feet (default = , min = 0, mas = )
•	list of materials (product string, int unit cost, int coverage per sq ft)
•	int number of days (default = )
•	int hours worked per day (per worker)
•	int labor dollars per hour
•	int number of hotel rooms
•	int number of hotel nights
•	int hotel dollars per night
•	int food dollars per day (per worker)
•	int number of vehicles
•	int number of miles per vehicle
•	float dollars per mile
•	list of miscellaneous costs (string desc, int dollars)
•	float multiplier [Santosh, Girish, Yashwanth]		
2.	As an administrator, from the opening page, I want an easy way to create a new estimate, either by starting with the default values or by copying from an existing estimate. (We could put a + at the top to create with default values and a + button on each estimate card to copy from that estimate.)[Girish, Yashwanth]		
3.	As an administrator, I want to see an opening page showing cards with recent estimates (name, location, year, month), with the most recent estimate at the top.[Yashwanth]		

4.	As an administrator, when copying from an existing estimate, I want to be redirected to the create estimate page with all fields transferred over exactly, except the unique job name, which should be the same, except with a (1) after it to make it unique.[Santosh, Yashwanth]		
5.	Optional: As an administrator, I want my work saved after every modification (please don't make me click save - I might forget and my estimate would be lost).[Girish, Yashwanth]		
6.	As an administrator, while creating a new estimate, I want to see the job cost in dollars and $/sqft while I change the entries. (Could we put this in a footer bar so as numbers change, the costs change as the user changes numbers - e.g. watch price change as sqft increases)[Yashwanth]
