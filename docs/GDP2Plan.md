## Project
This project involves creating a progressive app that can be viewed online and/or installed as an Android or iOS app. The app must be NWMSU branded and will be used to provide a variety of information about the new Carl & Cheryl Hughes Fieldhouse. The app must provide a variety of useful information (e.g., floor plans and layouts, event schedules, videos, access to the Astra scheduling system, and other information).

A simple, but fully-tested and reviewed version (e.g., with just URL links) should be available for the grand opening on Friday, October 12, 2018.
