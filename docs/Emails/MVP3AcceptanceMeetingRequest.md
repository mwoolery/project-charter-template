Hello all,

I hope you enjoyed your free day off this past Monday due to the snow but as you may have noticed we missed our originally scheduled time to meet and go over the remaining acceptance criteria for the Hughes Fieldhouse app. 

Agenda
1.	Review remaining items acceptance criteria’s to see if the app meets all needs
2.	Discuss remaining changes that will happen after criteria’s are accepted.
3.	Answer any remaining questions and address anything that is not accepted. 

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns in regards to this meeting or the app.

Thanks,

Matt
