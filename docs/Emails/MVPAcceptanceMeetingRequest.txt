Hello all,

I would like to invite you to our acceptance criteria review meeting for our MVP 1 and 2 release.  Fieldhouse team I appreciate the gesture of creating the invite for us but it is also required for our class to submit a copy of an invite that we sent out so feel free to accept this one instead.

Agenda
1.	Review the acceptance criteria for MVP 1
2.	Review the acceptance criteria for MVP 2
3.	Look at the acceptance criteria for MVP 3 to see if we can cross some of those off.
4.	Go over the Remaining plan (Deferred User Stories and Plans originally for our 2nd semester)


The link below is to the acceptance criteria list so you can review it before hand and ask any questions

As usual let me know if you have any questions about what is going on with the app or about this meeting

Thanks,

Matt Woolery
