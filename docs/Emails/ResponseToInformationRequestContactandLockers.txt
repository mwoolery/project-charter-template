Matt,
I have created a calendar invite and I plan to be at your class on Monday.
1.	Go ahead and list myself for the contact information for reservations and we can change it to Greg if needed.  Brooke Byland - bbyland@nwmissouri.edu
2.	For the lockers page, I am thinking pictures of the area.  I do not see participants caring about the square footage of the area.

We will talk more Monday.
Thanks,
