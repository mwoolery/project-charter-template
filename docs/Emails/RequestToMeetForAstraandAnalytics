Subject: Short Meeting to Discuss Astra and Google Analytics use on Fieldhouse App

Greg and Brooke,

I am reaching out today to see if there is a time that you would like to meet for a few minutes this week to cover a few updates and that way I can get you all added to the Analytics page and show you how it works.  Also we can look at the astra calendar that we have on the site currently that way we can make sure that only the information that is needed shows up instead of some of the repeated information that sometimes shows up now.  I think the meeting should only take 15 to 20 minutes at most so if there is a time that I could drop by this week to give some updates let me know what time would work for either one of you.  It’ll just be me showing up for this meeting and I don’t think the things that we will cover will necessarily require your GA’s to be present for since it is information that will be pertaining to you two primarily.  Let me know of a time that will work and if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks,

Matt
