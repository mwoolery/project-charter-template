API TESTING :
To include testing for API's we proposed to include like navigation to the location of events and Notifications through twitter API

Common Tests performed on API's
- Return Value based on input condition - The return value from the API's are checked based on the input condition.
- Verify if the API's does not return anything.
- Verify if the API triggers some other event or calls another API. The Events output should be tracked and verified.
- Verify if the API is updating any data structure.
- Verifying the behaviour of the API which is considering the external environment conditions such as files, peripheral devices, and so forth.
- Verifying the Sequence of API calls and check if the API's produce useful results from successive calls.

FEATURE TESTING :
How to Effectively Test a Feature ?
- Understanding the Feature : One Should read the requirement or specification corresponding to that feature thoroughly.

- Build Test Scenarios : Testers should Develop the test cases exclusively to test the feature. Hence, the coverage, traceability can be maintained.

- Prepare Positive and Negative DataSets : Testers should have the test data covering all possible negative, positive and boundary cases before the start of the testing.

- How it is Implemented : Testers should know how the feature has been implemented on application layer and the relevant changed to the back end if any. This will give us clarity on the impacted areas.

- Deploy the Build Early : Testers should start testing the feature early in the cycle and report the defects and the same process should be repeated throughout the release builds.
