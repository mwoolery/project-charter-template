Brooke,

Yes the time works great for us, I know some of us may need to leave just a couple of minutes earlier than 2:00pm to get to classes but I think we should be able to get a lot done in that hour. I have included a list of those of us who are planning on attending so you have an idea of roughly how many people will be planning to be there.

Teammates Confirmed Attending
Matt Woolery
Yashwanth Reddy Bommineni
Sai charan Gurudu

Sai Ram Vankina

Let me know if you or your team have any questions or concerns

Thank you,

Matt Woolery
