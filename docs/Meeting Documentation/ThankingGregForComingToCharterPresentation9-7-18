Subject: Thanks For Coming To Our Charter Presentation for the Fieldhouse App

Greg and Brooke,

We appreciate you two taking the time out of your busy day to come visit our class to give us some valuable feedback on our project charter presentation.  We will be taking your feedback into consideration and apply some updates to accommodate your concerns.  Greg, we will be getting back in touch with you in the next couple of weeks to begin working on the next steps and start the discussion of planning the project schedule.

Thank you,

Matt Woolery
