Subject: Invitation to Project Charter Presentation

VP Greg Hansen,

I would like to formally invite you to our presentation tomorrow over the project charter for the Hughes Fieldhouse Progressive Web App.  You can view the charter online at https://vijaythecoder.github.io/project-charter-template/ .  Please keep in mind that we will be updating some of the items on here tonight so it may appear different by tomorrow when we present.

Location:             VLK 111
Time:                     Friday 9/7/18, 9:00 am

On the Agenda:  Presentation over the project charter  (?)
                                Time for Input and questioning after presentation (5 min)
                                Discussion for Phase 2 (Time permitting)

You may notice that I have listed the presentation duration as a (?), this is because I am currently unsure how long we will be permitted to present for due to the fact there will have to be time for 3 other presentations in the class.  I anticipate it being around 10 minutes at the moment.

If you have any comments, questions, or concerns, feel free to email me or any of my team members.

Thanks,

Matthew Woolery
