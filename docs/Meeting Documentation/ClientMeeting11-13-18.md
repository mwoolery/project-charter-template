## Reviewing Acceptance Criterias
- Front page has contact information with clickable emails and phonenumbers. Greg has seen that these changes have been implemented.
- Experience the facility link goes to Northwest page (https://www.nwmissouri.edu/HughesFieldhouse/experience.htm) that shows the information about the facility.  Verified by Greg
- Twitter/Instagram/Facebook links.  Social media links included.  Also twitter and facebook feeds included. Greg thought the instagram feed seemed unneccassary so it is left out.  Verified by Greg
- Google Analytics.  Demonstrated in previous meeting and they were added to the page.  Verified by Greg and Brooke on 11-2
- Link to Brick Donation page.  Called the link donate to walk of champions which links to northwest brick and paver donation page.  Verified by Greg
- Floor Plans was removed in favor of linking to Brick donations.  Removed and Brick Donations page verified by Greg
- Showed the banner editor page and how it puts text onto the homepage and gets added and removed.  Verified by Greg
- Locker page has image and information about the locker rooms and public use lockers.  Verified by Greg
- Contact Form.  I forgot to review this with them but in previous meetings they wanted more information gathered.  I sent an email requesting them to look review it
- Astra page moved to own page, link on the nav bar to current events which displays the astra information on a different page so it doesn't slow down index.  Verified by Greg
- Meeting Room information- Greg provided information that he wants to be displayed and I added it in.
- Login page was not completed at the time of this meeting.
- Has updated information and simple verbage.  Greg did not suggest any changes to the verbage and liked the information that is available

## Last minute changes
- Change the Hours to have different Wordage and remove the borders.  Completed
- Remove the black nav bar.  It was mentioned that this would be its own site so this is not actually needed since it isn't going to be a change to nwmissouri.edu.  Completed
- Add White background to text pages.  Some text didn't have a background and was hard to read with the picture background.  Competed
- Move admin login to the footer since it shouldn't be obvious to the user.  Completed
- Meeting Room information was provided.  Added in immediately after. Completed
- See if there is an acceptable background that could be added that is the fieldhouse instead of the admin building and bell tower. Looked for one but could not find

## Storyboard information finalized
- Clicked through all of the links on storyboard and verified that it is displaying what is expected

## Banner editor demonstration
- Showed how to use the banner editor and how it updates information on the index page like required
- Asked for date pickers instead of typing.  Completed
- Discussed a limit in how long the announcement would be and they said they would be ok with abbreviating some if needed.  Limited to 50 Characters and they can add multiple announcements per day for additional lines
- Change some of the wordage on the dates so it is clear what they were doing.  Completed
