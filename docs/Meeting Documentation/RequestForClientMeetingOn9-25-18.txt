Subject: Hughes Fieldhouse App Update Meeting

Greg,

I am reaching out to you today to see if you would like to set up a time where we can check-in on the progress of the Fieldhouse app.  We have a prototype that we will have you look at and provide us some feedback on and give us some things that you would like to see added or changed.  Let me know of an acceptable time that some of us can stop by and discuss what we have and to figure out how to proceed.  As usual let me know if you have any questions.

Matt Woolery
