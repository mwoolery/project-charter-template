## Project Purpose
To develop a progressive web apps for existing Hughes fieldhouse website and to make it user-friendly and full of information.
## Benefits
Anybody can access the application either on the web, or offline if they have downloaded the app to their phone
## User Roles

This application is used primarily by students.  The users of the app are included below.

1. General User
2. Fieldhouse Team

## Stories by Role

User Stories by above mentioned user roles

1. "I want to be able to find information about the Hughes Fieldhouse, be able to contact the Fieldhouse team if I need help or if I am interested in Reserving the field, and I want to be able understand the experience provided by the Fieldhouse.  I want to do this all in 3 clicks or less." 
2. "I want to do everything that the general user would want to do, but I also would like to provide some real time information to the site, that way people can feel like they are here, even if they are not."

Stories will be maintained in JIRA.

## ER Diagram

 An ER Diagram, at least for this phase and looking at the current scope requirements, is not needed since the app is not tracking data but tracking links instead.  Links can be hard coded in since the current scope suggests that the client wants to link to other sites related to services that are needed for each role.  An ER Diagram may be needed in the future as the scope increases, such as the client mentioning that in the future they may want an admin side that allows the admins to post news stories or create push notifications via an application that only the admins have access to.


 ## Sample Pages to be Tracked

 As mentioned in the ER Diagram section, there is not currently going to be a need for a database, but sites that would need to be linked to include ones that are seen on the Foster Fitness Center's page on nwmissouri.edu.  It is likely that the client would want to see links to these pages on the home page.

 -https://www.nwmissouri.edu/HughesFieldhouse/webcam.htm

Other sites may need to be included or some of these maybe decided to be not needed in the future.  The client wishes to have it look similar to https://www.nwmissouri.edu/StudentSuccess/ .  Information from https://www.nwmissouri.edu/crec/ can also be included.

## Scope

### Phase 1 - Conception and initiation (Module 1)

Phase 1 involves a friendly competition between muliple teams, 
each completing a quick (2-week, 1 module) exercise to develop a vision for the project 
on a given platform. In competitions, this exercise may be done in an afternoon. 
During Phase 1, the teams will work independently and each vision will be shared with the client. 

Deliverables:

- Project charter
- Supporting artifacts (as described in this document)
- Contract (link - the contract will reference this charter and supporting documents)

This phase includes the development of:


- [Stories by Role](https://vijaythecoder.github.io/project-charter-template/Documents/StoriesByRoles.pdf)
- [Initial acceptance criteria](https://vijaythecoder.github.io/project-charter-template/Documents/AcceptanceCriteria.pdf)
- ER Diagram - Not Needed Due to no need for Database
- Initial sample data - Not Needed Due to no need for Database
-[Pages Information](https://github.com/vijaythecoder/project-charter-template/blob/master/Documents/Supplement%20Items/Page%20Layout.xlsx)
- [Initial project sketch Content](https://vijaythecoder.github.io/project-charter-template/Documents/UI%20Designs/Content.PNG)
- [Initial project sketch Menu](https://vijaythecoder.github.io/project-charter-template/Documents/UI%20Designs/Home.PNG)
- For each phase, initial scope, schedule, budget (included in this document)
- [Original RFP](https://github.com/profcase/rfp-fieldhouse/blob/master/index.md)

### Phase 2 - Definition and planning (Module 2 and 3)

During Phase 2, the best parts of each platform-specific charter will be used to create a single, 
consolidated charter that allows different platforms to share fundamental aspects such as the E-R diagram and 
sample data.

Deliverables:

- Combined project charter
- Integrated supporting artifacts (taking the best from Phase 1)

Include:

- [stories by role](https://github.com/vijaythecoder/project-charter-template/blob/master/Documents/StoriesByRole.pdf)
- Final acceptance criteria (see above)
- [ER Diagram]([stories by role](https://github.com/vijaythecoder/project-charter-template/blob/master/Documents/StoriesByRole.pdf)) 
- Final set of sample data (link)
- Detailed project sketches by platform (link - images must be displayed)
- Architectural decisions, including platforms, languages, frameworks, libraries, cloud resources, data stores, releases, milestones, authentication, authorization, responsive supports, progressive supports, security, performance requirements, traditional or SPA, client-side rendering vs server-side rendering, REST vs GraphQL, web vs native vs hybrid, etc.
- List of projects with versions in JIRA
- Schedules for sprints, client presentations, milestones and acceptance criteria in JIRA
- Construction of product backlogs built from epics, stories, tasks, and subtasks in JIRA

### Phase 3 - Implementation of architectural prototypes (Module 4 and 5)

During Phase 3, new teams will be defined to work in parallel (again in friendly competition) to build platform-specific architectural prototypes to identify any major issues with the plan. 

Deliverables:

- Updated versions of all artifacts
- JIRA management system
- Working prototype deployed in each proposed platform
- Presentation of architectural prototype to client and extended team (include pros & cons of these choices).
- Together with the client decide what platform(s) will be selected for implementation.
- Client acceptance of the plan

### Phase 4 - System requirement specification (Module 6)

Based on the results and lessons learned during the architectural prototypes, finalize the requirements to be used during the coming implementation phase.

Finalize implementation plan (including all remaining phases along with scope, schedule, and budget by phase).

Deliverables:

- Complete implementation plan for next semester.
- Suggested project organization for next semester.
- Signed acceptance by the client with comments.

## Out of scope

The following items are specifically not included in this scope of work:

## Schedule

The following general schedule will be followed:

- Phase 1 completed and presented at the end of week 2. 
- Client feedback and updates completed at the end of week 3.
- Phase 2 completed and presented at the end of week 7.
- Client feedback and updates completed at the end of week 8.
- Phase 3 completed and presented at the end of week 12.
- Client feedback and updates completed at the end of week 13.
- Phase 4 finalized and published at the end of week 14.
- Client feedback and updates completed at the end of week 15.
- Project reflections and discussions completed during week 16.

You will develop the schedule for next semester as part of this work. 

The complete schedule is shown in the following Gantt chart:
- Display or link to the current project Gantt chart 
- Schedule by work tasks by phase
- Include through final implementation (next semester)
- Include durations, dependencies, and key milestones

## Budget

Present project budget table here. 

- Budget must be by phase by team role.
- For each role, assume each contributor will be working 10-12 billable hours per week for 15 weeks per semester
- Use real-world billing rates. A company must bill you at twice your salary or more - practice proving your worth. 
- Within the team, be specific on what each role will contribute to the budget and how this will be documented.

## Risk

The following have been identified as risks that could contribute to not making scope, budget, or schedule:

- The client changes requirements mid-project...

## Acceptance criteria

- For each story, enumerate and clearly describe the acceptance criteria. 
- Be specific - your client may have a very different definition of vague words.
